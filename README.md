Project Summary: FMCG Service Level Dashboard using Power BI and Excel
Project Title: Service Level Performance Dashboard for Mart FMCG
Objective

Develop a Power BI dashboard to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) for service levels—specifically on-time delivery (OT) %, in full delivery (IF) %, and on-time in full (OTIF) %—to enhance operational efficiency and support Mart FMCG in preemptively addressing issues before business expansion.
Background

Mart, a leading manufacturer in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector, required a robust tool to track and analyze service level performance. Identifying inefficiencies in delivery performance is critical for maintaining high service standards and planning effective business expansion. This dashboard aimed to provide actionable insights to improve delivery processes and support strategic decision-making.
Methodology

    Data Collection:
        Source: Internal operational systems and existing Excel reports.
        Data Points: Delivery schedules, quantities, timeliness, and fulfillment status.

    Data Processing:
        Tools: Excel for initial data cleaning and preparation.
        Processes: Aggregated raw data to compute the KPIs (OT, IF, OTIF).

    Dashboard Development:
        Platform: Power BI.
        Features: Interactive visuals and filters for detailed analysis.
            OT%: Proportion of deliveries made on or before the scheduled time.
            IF%: Proportion of deliveries meeting the full quantity ordered.
            OTIF%: Proportion of deliveries that are both on time and in full.
        Functionality:
            Real-time data updates for ongoing monitoring.
            Drill-down capabilities for granular analysis by product, region, and time period.
            Trend analysis to identify patterns and deviations.

    Insights and Recommendations:
        Highlighted frequent delays and short shipments, enabling targeted improvements.
        Suggested operational adjustments based on performance trends to preemptively address potential issues.

Key Achievements

    Enhanced Visibility: Provided a comprehensive view of delivery performance metrics in an intuitive format.
    Actionable Insights: Facilitated the identification of bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the delivery process.
    Investment Efficiency: The analysis projected a 20% reduction in expansion investment by optimizing existing processes based on dashboard insights, minimizing the need for additional resources.

Conclusion

The Power BI dashboard significantly improved Mart’s ability to monitor and manage service level performance. By providing clear and actionable insights into OT, IF, and OTIF metrics, the tool has equipped Mart with the necessary information to fine-tune operations and prepare for a more efficient and informed business expansion. The projected 20% savings in expansion investments further underscores the dashboard’s value in strategic planning and operational efficiency.
